# ML_Project1-KNN-
First Model training and getting Accuracy . Further details in Readme
Link to dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data
Learned about KNN , its intuition
learned about test train split function of sklearn
have previous knowledge of test train split so no barriers their for me 
scaling values and found out the formula by which it is done beneath 
standard scaler and its formula using mean and standar deviation
transforming data 
importing kNN and fitting data on it with nneighbours understanding 
importing accuracty form sklearn and getting accuracy of model
got accuracy score
learned about approaches to get K Heuristic and experimentatl 
placing k values in a range and mapping the accuracy score on plt plot to get best k value which was three and gave 99% accuracy
Also learned a bit about decision surface and its further usese
Learned obout over and underfiting and about which i also had previous knowledge
learned about tradeoff between variance and bias
learned about limitation of KNN like 
1- Failure on large datasets
2- Failure on High dimension data due to curse of dimensionality
3- Failure on dataset having many outliers
4- Non Homogenous sclae problem as it distrubs the distance measurment
5- Imbalance datasets can lead to biasness
6- not good for inference as it dosen't shows the impact of feature driving value
